Intelligent Triage Using Existing Patient Data + Real-Time Complaint
(Eye Hospital Use Case)
1. What “Existing Patient Data” Means in an Eye Hospital

If a patient already exists (MRN / Hospital ID), the database usually contains:

A. Demographic & Risk Data

Age

Gender

Diabetes / Hypertension status

Previous eye surgeries

Systemic diseases

B. Eye History

Previous diagnoses (glaucoma, cataract, DR, etc.)

Last recorded visual acuity

Last recorded IOP

Operated eye details

One-eyed patient flag

C. Visit History

Last visit date

Frequency of visits

Missed follow-ups

Previous ESI / urgency tags

📌 This data is GOLD for triage.

2. Why Combining Old + New Data Is Critical
❌ Problem with only real-time complaint

“Mild pain” may look low priority

But patient may have:

advanced glaucoma

only one functional eye

recent surgery

✅ Benefit of combining

The same complaint can mean very different urgency for different patients.

Triage is contextual, not absolute.

3. High-Level Logic (Very Important)

Final Triage Priority = Real-Time Severity × Patient Risk Context

4. Step-by-Step Triage Flow (Existing Patient)
STEP 1: Patient Identification

Patient enters ID / scans QR / fingerprint

System fetches:

full eye history

risk flags

{
  "patient_id": "AEH10234",
  "age": 62,
  "diabetic": true,
  "diagnosis": ["glaucoma"],
  "one_eyed": true,
  "last_iop": 28,
  "last_visit": "2025-12-01"
}

STEP 2: Real-Time Complaint Capture

Voice / text input:

“I have eye pain since morning”

Structured questions:

Sudden vision loss? (Yes/No)

Pain score (0–10)

Trauma? Chemical exposure?

STEP 3: Real-Time Screening (Optional AI)

Eye redness

Pupil size

Blink rate

Eye alignment

{
  "eye_redness": "Moderate",
  "pupil_size": "Dilated"
}

5. Risk Context Scoring (THIS IS THE KEY)

Each patient gets a Risk Context Score from historical data.

Example Risk Factors & Weights
Condition	Weight
Age > 60	+1
Diabetes	+2
Glaucoma	+3
One-eyed patient	+4
Recent eye surgery (<30 days)	+4
High IOP history	+3
Missed follow-ups	+1
Risk Score = 1 + 2 + 4 + 3 = 10 (HIGH RISK)

6. Dynamic ESI Adjustment Logic
Base ESI (from complaint only)

Example:

“Eye pain” → ESI-3

Risk-Adjusted ESI
IF Risk Score ≥ threshold
    upgrade ESI by 1 level

Example:

Base ESI-3

Risk score high
➡ Final ESI-2

📌 This is how intelligence is added without AI hallucination.

7. Exact Rules for Priority Upgrade (Eye Hospital)
Upgrade Conditions (ANY ONE):

One-eyed patient + pain

Glaucoma patient + headache / pain

Diabetic + redness / vision change

Post-operative eye + any symptom

Elderly (>70) + vision complaint

Rule Example:
IF one_eyed = TRUE AND complaint != "routine"
→ ESI = min(ESI - 1, ESI-1)

8. Example Real Scenarios (VERY IMPORTANT)
Scenario 1: Same Complaint, Different Priority
Patient	Complaint	History	Final ESI
Young patient	Mild pain	No history	ESI-3
Glaucoma patient	Mild pain	One-eyed	ESI-2
Scenario 2: Follow-Up Patient with Red Flags

Complaint: “Just irritation”

History:

Recent cataract surgery (10 days ago)
➡ ESI-2 (post-op risk)

Scenario 3: Diabetic Retinopathy Patient

Complaint: “Blurred vision”

History:

Diabetic

Missed last follow-up
➡ ESI-2 (retinal risk)

9. Final Queue Priority Calculation
Final Priority =
    Base ESI Priority
  + Risk Context Boost
  + Waiting Time Aging


This feeds directly into the priority queue system you designed earlier.

10. What the Token Should Show (Trust Factor)
TOKEN: B-145
PRIORITY: 🟠 HIGH
REASON:
• Known glaucoma patient
• Eye pain reported
NEXT: Doctor – Priority Lane


📌 Doctors LOVE seeing the “WHY”.

11. Safety Layer (MANDATORY)

Nurse / MLOP sees:

New complaint
